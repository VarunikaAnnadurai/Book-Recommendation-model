  <h1>Book Recommendation System</h1>
  
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>This project aims to develop a book recommendation system that provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their preferences and reading history. The system leverages various machine learning models and data analysis techniques to enhance the book discovery experience for readers.</p>

  <h3>Data Collection</h3>
  <p>The project begins with the collection of book-related data, including book titles, authors, prices, publishers, the number of pages, sales rank, and genres. The data is scraped from online sources and stored in a structured format.</p>

  <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
  <p>Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, converting data types, and cleaning the dataset to ensure it's ready for analysis and model training.</p>

  <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
  <p>The EDA phase involves analyzing the dataset to gain insights into book-related trends, distributions, and relationships. Visualization techniques are used to present the findings.</p>

  <h3>Outlier Detection</h3>
  <p>Outliers in the dataset are identified and analyzed, considering their impact on the book recommendation system. Outliers provide valuable insights into unique and diverse book preferences.</p>

  <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
  <p>The project explores various machine learning models, including regression, classification, clustering, and association rule mining. Models are trained and evaluated for their accuracy in providing book recommendations.</p>

  <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
  <p>Model performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), Explained Variance, and Accuracy Percentage.</p>

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>The project uses Python and various libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and more for data analysis and machine learning.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/VarunikaAnnadurai/book-recommendation.git</code></li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
    <li>Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis and models.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use this project as a foundation for your book recommendation system.</p>
